Kill-me-now-Stamina - a fatigue mod that you will learn to hate.

## About
This is an Arma 3 modification that adds a hard fatigue system to the standard fatigue system that is currently present in Arma. What this means is that during the course of the mission your character will feel increasingly exhausted which affects how fast he loses his stamina and can even cause him not being able to run anymore.  
The goal of this mod is to increase the focus on how you use your human resources and to increase the importance of motorized infantry.

## Requirements
This mod requires the [Community Base Addons](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/).
